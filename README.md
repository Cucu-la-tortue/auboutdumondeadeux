# Introduction
This is the a quick starter project with scss, partials, and a base structure that I use to quickly build websites.


# Scripts
### Start your website :
``` 
npm run start
```
And then go to `localhost:1234`  

### Prefix your css :
``` 
npm run prefix
```

# Handling changes
If you need to change things such as navbar for example, you will find all the reusable component througout the pages in the folder : `/src/scss`.
